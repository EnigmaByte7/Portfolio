            <div class="child"><p>I believe that softwares should be freely and equally accessible to everyone, and that we should develop our own Indian softwares, web browsers and serch engines that should be at par in terms of quality , be available at minimum costs, and used not only in India but will be recognised internationally. This will help us become independent in terms of softwares and ensure privacy. I'm not against any countries softwares.<br><br>I also want to contribute in the open source community and develop technological solutions to the day to day problems</p></div>
